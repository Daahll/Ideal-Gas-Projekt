# Ideal-Gas-Projekt
This simulation will provide first-year engineering undergraduates with  hands-on experience of ideal gases. Users explore the behaviour of a closed ideal gas system by setting its thermodynamic state variables/constants (e.g., 𝑝, 𝑉, 𝑇, 𝐸𝐼 , 𝑆), applying work  and/or heat to the system.
